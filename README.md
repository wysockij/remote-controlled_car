# Remote-controlled car

A remote-controlled car project that I made for my electronics studies.
It is an old toy car that was originally controlled with a controller. We took it apart and used Bluetooth to communicate between the car and a smartphone app.

## Device used in this project:
- Blackpill STM32F411CEU6
- bluetooth module - HC-06
- ultrasonic distance sensor - HC-SR04
- editor - STM32CubeIDE
- Android app - RoboRemoFree
- toy car

## Project organisation:
- *remote-controlled_car/* - directory with the project
- *doc/* - directory with documentation and images (documentation generated with **Doxygen**)
